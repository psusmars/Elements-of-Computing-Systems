Compiler for Elements of Computing Systems

README

The driver program for my compiler is Compiler.jar.  To run my compiler you must run it from a command window passing in the file extension for a parameter for example:
Directory> Compiler.jar SomeFolder/SomeFile.vm
You can also pass in a folder as a parameter i.e.
Directory> Compiler.jar SomeFolder/
	In this case, the folder will load all ".vm" files and combine all the code into one ".asm" file, with the same name as the folder, i.e.
	Directory\SomeFolder\SomeFolder.asm
The file passed in must be a virtual machine file of type ".vm" (for the first case), and upon execution, a ".asm" hack file will be generated to the same file location as the virtual machine file. So in this example the output would be found as such:
Directory\SomeFolder\SomeFile.asm
