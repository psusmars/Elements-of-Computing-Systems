README

The driver program for our Jack Compiler is JackCompiler.Jar.  To run our compiler you must run it from a command window passing in the file extension for a parameter for example:
Directory> JackCompiler.Jar SomeFolder/SomeFile.vm
You can also pass in a folder as a parameter i.e.
Directory> JackCompiler.Jar SomeFolder/
	Assume some folder has: Main.jack, foo.jack, bar.jack
	In this case, the folder will load all ".jack" files and create a ".vm" file for each file in the director, i.e.
	Directory\SomeFolder\Main.vm
	Directory\SomeFolder\foo.vm
	Directory\SomeFolder\bar.vm
The file passed in must be a source file of type ".jack" (for the first case), and upon execution, a ".vm" virtual machine file will be generated to the same file location as the source file. So in this example the output would be found as such:
Directory\SomeFolder\SomeFile.vm
