VM Translator for Elements of Computing Systems
March 22, 2011
README

The driver program for my Virtual Machine Translator is VMTranslator.Jar.  To run my compiler you must run it from a command window passing in the file extension for a parameter for example:
Directory> VMTranslator.Jar SomeFolder/SomeFile.vm
You can also pass in a folder as a parameter i.e.
Directory> VMTranslator.Jar SomeFolder/
	In this case, the folder will load all ".vm" files and combine all the code into one ".asm" file, with the same name as the folder, i.e.
	Directory\SomeFolder\SomeFolder.asm
The file passed in must be a virtual machine file of type ".vm" (for the first case), and upon execution, a ".asm" hack file will be generated to the same file location as the virtual machine file. So in this example the output would be found as such:
Directory\SomeFolder\SomeFile.asm

WARNING!!!
My parser assumes that there has to be the system initialization added at the beginning of every ".asm" file.  So it will only work on folders that include the Sys.vm file.
